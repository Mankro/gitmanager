This folder is used for unit testing the git functions in util/git.py.

The dotgit folder is the .git folder normally seen in a git repo. It has been
renamed so that it can be committed to the git manager repo. In order to
modify that repo, use `--git-dir dotgit` in the git commands, or rename the
directory to .git, run your commands and then rename it back to dotgit when
you are done.
